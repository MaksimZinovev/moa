<ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_CHECK>

Acceptance criteria under review: 
"""
When running the Service Provider Load menu, the load program will recognise the RemedialMassageTherapist file and load the data from the file into the system
"""

Review notes: 
Not specific. “recognise the RemedialMassageTherapist file” is not specific. How do I know that file is recognised? 

AC is incomplete. In the test proof I can see that in addition to uploading data, system should produce report as per business logic. Would this work be considered completed if we do not check this? Probably not. Hence this should be in AC

Improved version [improved acceptance criteria as a numberd list or Gherkin ]
