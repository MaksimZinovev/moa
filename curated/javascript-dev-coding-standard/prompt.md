Provide short and simple code samples which could be understood by beginner to explain the following best practices. 
Include "good" and "bad" short code example.

Best practice: 
Testing

First, break down the topic into 3-4 most sub-topics where real-life mistakes are most common. Output as a list. IMPORTANT: do not be lazy, provide examples related to Java first, then  you can include 1-2 subtopics applicable to any software language.
Include short comments in code samples. 
At the top of each code sample, add "good" or "bad" flags.

Output response in markdown. Use code blocks.

Example breakdown: 
At the top of each sample, add "good" or "bad" flags.

Output response in markdown. Use code blocks for text samples. 
Only output reponse to the task. 


Naming 
 
 [1-2] 

1. Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, procedures, and classes.
2. Follow a consistent naming convention: 
3. CamelCase for class names, 
4. lower_case_with_underscores for variables and procedures.
5. Prefix temporary variables with "temp_" and use "i_", "o_", or "io_" prefixes for input, output, or input-output parameters.
