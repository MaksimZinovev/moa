## Act as a world-class senior Java  software engineer. 


Act as a world-class senior Java  software engineer. 


Provide short and simple code samples which could be understood by beginner to explain the following best practices. 
Include "good" and "bad" example.

Best practice: 
Testing

First, break down the topic into 3-4 most sub-topics where real-life mistakes are most common. Output as a list. IMPORTANT: do not be laizy, provide examples related to Java first, then  you can include 1-2 subtopics applicable to any software language.
Include short comments in code samples. 
At the top of each code sample, add "good" or "bad" flags.

Output response in markdown. Use code blocks.

Example breakdown: Testing

"""

1. **Unit Testing**: Unit testing helps catch bugs early and ensures individual components function correctly.

2. **Mocking Dependencies**: Mocking dependencies allows for isolated testing, ensuring tests are reliable and not influenced by external factors.

3. **Test Coverage**: High test coverage reduces the risk of undetected bugs and increases confidence in the code's reliability.

4. **Assertions**: Strong assertions provide clear validation, making it easier to identify and fix issues when tests fail.
